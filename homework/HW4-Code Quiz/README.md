# Execution plan

1. Create HTML framework and CSS styles
* Navigation bar at the top to access Highscores and restart the quiz and/or go back to the welcome page. 
* Welcome page, and quiz take place on same index.html
* 
* Minimalist aesthetics for quiz styling

2. Quiz logic
* Welcome message outlines rules for the quiz with a button to start
* 10 questions about JavaScript basics
* 6 seconds per question, so 60 seconds in total
* Timer starts when quiz is started
* Incorrect answer deducts 5 seconds from timer
* Questions must be answered correctly before game moves to the next question
* Quiz ends when all questions are answered or timer runs out
* Scores are calculated on numerical seconds/time left over.
* Player can enter initals to be submitted to highcores and taken to the highscores page
* Highscores displayed from quiz in descending order from high to low based on time-scoring in highscores.html
* Sound effects on buttons, welcome screen, start quiz, quiz over, time out and high scores are super smooth and provide optimal sensory feedback to user.
