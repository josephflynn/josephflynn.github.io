          <p>I am a contemporary artist and IT professional, having worked in IT Services as an IT Help Desk Officer 
            at The University of Melbourne for a few years from 2013 before taking a vocational break to focus on my 
            Art career in 2015. I earned a Master of Contemporary Arts from The Victorian College of the Arts, 
            The University of Melbourne in 2017 and undertook a short course at General Assembly in Front End Web Development
            in the same year. I have exhibited in over 35 group exhibitions, held over 14 solo
            exhibitions in Melbourne, Dallas, Lisbon, Copenhagen and New York City, and collaborated in 3 duo shows. My most notably recent
            exhibition was held in Copenhagen as a collaboration between myself and Danish artist 
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bakbash" alt="Anna Bak Instagram">Anna Bak</a> titled 
            <a href="https://www.idoart.dk/kalender/fsc-battle-6-gone-by-joseph-flynn-vs-anna-bak" alt="IDOART.DK Article">
            FSC BATTLE #6 â€“ G.ON.E. Joseph Flynn VS Anna Bak</a>.
          <br><br>
            During my final year of studies at The VCA (2017), I started a creative studio and exhibition space, titled 
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/memphisgardens/" alt="Memphis Gardens Instagram">Memphis gardens</a>, which
            unfortunately closed in 2019. I then started working as a freelance creative for art, architecture and design companies
            such as <a href="https://www.eness.com/" alt="ENESS">ENESS</a> and <a href="http://octa.website/" alt="OCTA">OCTA</a>
            assisting with installations in Melbourne and around the world. <br>During the outbreak of COVID-19 I was working on an
            installation in Shanghai, China. I had to leave my work to return to Australia and decided that I needed to find a more secure 
            field of employment, at which point I decided to return to IT and study my current course in Full Stack Web Development 
            with Monash Coding Bootcamp.
